## 📚 Publications & Public Engagement

### Book (Authored)
I was approached by a major trade press in Korea to author the educational book for teenagers, ***If We Could Change the World with Coding***. This project reflects my commitment to public outreach by clearly articulating the necessity of **digital literacy** and **civic-minded coding**.

### Civic Engagement
My commitment to a healthier society is reinforced by my work as an operations team member and spokesperson for **BIYN** ([link](https://newsbikr.wordpress.com/biyn-%ec%86%8c%ea%b0%9c/)), a civic organization. This continuous practical action demonstrates my resolve to translate technological reflection into meaningful deployment.
