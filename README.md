## 🔎 Research Focus
My academic and professional journey is driven by a core question: **How can we detect, measure, and mitigate technical harms arising from large-scale algorithmic systems?**

My research agenda integrates the following interdisciplinary approaches:
1.  **Sociotechnical Interpretability:** Combining quantitative signals with qualitative user studies to uncover sociotechnical harms not captured by logs alone.
2.  **Value-Aware Metrics:** Designing measurable metrics (e.g., diversity, fairness) that can be integrated into system design to coexist with business goals.
3.  **Multi-layered Harm Analysis:** Building robust systems through multi-signal detection that combines content, user behavior, and social context.

## 📚 Publications & Public Engagement

### Book (Authored)
I was approached by a major trade press in Korea to author the educational book for teenagers, ***If We Could Change the World with Coding***. This project reflects my commitment to public outreach by clearly articulating the necessity of **digital literacy** and **civic-minded coding**.

### Civic Engagement
My commitment to a healthier society is reinforced by my work as an operations team member and spokesperson for **BIYN**, a civic organization. This continuous practical action demonstrates my resolve to translate technological reflection into meaningful deployment.
